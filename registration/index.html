    <p>
        Registration is open until <strong>March 21, 2025</strong> 
        (<a target="_blank" href="https://washington.irisregistration.com/Form/7047">please follow this link</a>). 
        The registration fee covers participation in all plenary sessions. 
        In-person attendees will also have access to breakout discussions, as well as coffee and meal services. 
        Registration fee is as follows
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>General attendees: $250</li>
        <li>Early career attendees (Students and PhD received in 2020 or later): $150</li>
        <li>Remote participants: $50</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        During registration, we strongly encourage all participants to submit a presentation (a title
        and abstract). Most will be assigned as posters, with a limited number selected for oral presentations. 
        Given the collaborative nature of this workshop, ample time will be dedicated to group 
        discussions aimed at developing research projects and proposals. Having a presentation 
        from each participant will greatly enhance this process.
    </p>
