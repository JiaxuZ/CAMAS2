    <h2>What is CAMAS?</h2>
    <p>
        <!--This website is a template that you could use for a (small) academic conference.

        The Consortium for the Advancement of Marine Arctic Science (CAMAS) was established in 2023 to 
        facilitate and enhance international collaboration on marine Arctic science. It has been motivated 
        in part by the demonstrated need for, and accomplishments of, similar past efforts, i.e., 
        the Forum for Arctic Ocean Modeling and Observational Synthesis (FAMOS) 
        and the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (AOMIP). The overall aim of CAMAS is to advance 
        the understanding and model representation of key marine Arctic processes that contribute to the 
        rapid changes in the Arctic. In particular, CAMAS will focus on the following themes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Drivers and impacts of ocean heat and freshwater transport into and out of the Arctic</li>
        <li>Ocean-ice-atmosphere interactions in a warming Arctic</li>
        <li>Biophysical impacts of Arctic marine biogeochemistry</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        CAMAS consist of three annual workshops to initiate, execute, and finalize coordinated activities that will advance 
        our understanding of these topics through multi-model analysis, model-observational synthesis, and the 
        development and evaluation of process-oriented metrics. Each workshop will be preceded by an Early-Career School. 
        The school will consist of lectures and activities on hot topics in the field, with ample discussion and social 
        time. Some funding is available to support travel costs for EC scientists.

            The first CAMAS Workshop and EC School</a> 
        took place successfully in February 2024 in Santa Fe, NM. The event convened 80 Arctic marine scientists 
        from around the globe, fostering discussions on current research and sparking ideas for collaborative 
        projects over the next three years of CAMAS.  A detailed workshop report is available in

    <h2>CAMAS2</h2>
    <p>
        The second CAMAS Workshop and Early-Career School is planned for <strong>April 16-18, 2025, in 
        Seattle, Washington</strong> (with some remote participation). The EC School will be on 
        <strong>April 15</strong> (in-person only).
        We strongly encourage in-person participation for the most productive discussions and interactions. 
        Options will be provided to join the workshop remotely, although some program elements will be in-person 
        only. The early-career school will be in-person only.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We strongly encourage all participants to submit an abstract during the registration process. 
        Most abstracts will be assigned a poster. We will select a few abstracts for oral presentations. 
        Early-career scientists can submit a brief description of their interests if no abstract is available. 
        Remote participants will have the opportunity to submit a presentation of their choice (poster, 
        slide deck, recording) that will be made available through a link on the online meeting agenda. 
        They will be given an opportunity for a 3-minute flash talk during the workshop.
    </p>
