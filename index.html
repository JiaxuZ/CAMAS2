    <h2>What is CAMAS?</h2>
    <p>
        <!--This website is a template that you could use for a (small) academic conference. -->
        <!--It&rsquo;s got a page for registration, where you can embed a Google Form or some other way for participants to register.-->
    
        The Consortium for the Advancement of Marine Arctic Science (CAMAS) was established in 2023 to facilitate and 
        enhance international collaboration on marine Arctic science. It has been motivated in part by the demonstrated need for, 
        and accomplishments of, similar past efforts, i.e., the Forum for Arctic Ocean Modeling and Observational Synthesis (FAMOS) 
        and the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (AOMIP). The overall aim of CAMAS is to advance the understanding and model 
        representation of key marine Arctic processes that contribute to the rapid changes in the Arctic. In particular, CAMAS will 
        focus on the following themes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&#8226;  Drivers and impacts of ocean heat and freshwater transport into and out of the Arctic</li>
        <li>&#8226;  Ocean-ice-atmosphere interactions in a warming Arctic</li>
        <li>&#8226;  Biophysical impacts of Arctic marine biogeochemistry</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        CAMAS consist of three annual workshops to initiate, execute, and finalize coordinated activities that will advance 
        our understanding of these topics through multi-model analysis, model-observational synthesis, and the 
        development and evaluation of process-oriented metrics. Each workshop will be preceded by an Early-Career School. 
        The school will consist of lectures and activities on hot topics in the field, with ample discussion and social 
        time. Some funding is available to support travel costs for EC scientists.

        <a target="_blank" href="https://web.cvent.com/event/c2f1da11-1eda-45cf-8cd5-9d09e7a73b95/summary">The first CAMAS Workshop and EC School</a> 
        took place successfully in February 2024 in Santa Fe, NM. The event convened 80 Arctic marine scientists 
        from around the globe, fostering discussions on current research and sparking ideas for collaborative 
        projects over the next three years of CAMAS.  A detailed workshop report is available in

    <h2>Organizers</h2>
    <p>
        Here&rsquo;s a good place to list the organizers and sponsors of the conference,
        as well as list contact information for the organizers,
        and show off the logos of the sponsors.
        It looks like his conference was sponsored by kittens!
